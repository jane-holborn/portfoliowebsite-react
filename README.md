# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed with a mobile-first approach to showcase my development skills, projects and coding journey. This site features a fun aquarium theme using CSS animations to give the page a playful, light-hearted interactive vibe. ü¶Äüêü

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** for structure and layout
- **CSS:** for styling, animations, and responsive design
- **TypeScript:** for type safety and better development experience
- **React:** for building reusable componetns and managing UI state
- **Vite:** for fast development and optimised builds

## Features

- **CSS Animations:** Bubbles rising up the page in varying opacity, sizes and speed, in conjunction with a linear gradient of colours to simulate the ocean.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Optimised layout for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
- **Single Scroll Design:** The website uses a single, continuous scroll to navigate through the content, creating a seamless intuitive user experience.
- **Performance & Accessibility:** Focus on SEO optimisation, fast load times, semantic HTML, alt text, ARIA labels, responsive design, and good colour contrast and text readability.

## Stretch Goals

- **Interactive Crab Animation:** Create a more complex animation where the crab skitters off the screen when clicked (desktop) or tapped (mobile). This will require combining JavaScript and CSS animations, which I plan to explore further as I advance my JS skills.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Improve the keyboard accessibility by ensuring that all interactive elements are fully navigable using the keyboard. This will involve implementing proper focus management, keyboard event handling, and ensuring that the site is usable without a mouse.
- **Project Pop-up with Side Scrolling:** Implement a pop-up feature for each project that displays project images, a link to the GitHub repository, and details about technology used. Add side-scrolling functionality to allow users to click left or right to navigate through multiple project photos. This will enhance user interaction and demonstrate advanced skills in UI/UX design and JavaScript.

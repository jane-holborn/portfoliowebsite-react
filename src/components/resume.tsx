          <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
          <p className="professionalSummaryStyling">
            After a decade in the offshore oil gas industry working as a
            production technician, I stepped away from my career to be home with
            my family and support my Dad.
            <br />
            <br />
            While caring for my Dad and navigating the many challenges of
            dementia, I found a new passion in tech and made the decision to
            swap steel caps for a keyboard one day. After my Dad moved into a
            high-care memory support unit in 2021, I found an amazing company
            who were happy for me to begin my IT journey with them part-time so
            I could still support my Dad until his passing in 2022.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2024 I made the decision to specialise in software engineering
            and enrolled in a Certificate IV in IT (Programming) at TAFE. Having
            successfully finished the Certificate IV in IT, I am now completing
            a Bachelor of Information Technology at Murdoch University. I'll be
            completing my degree part-time, so I am really excited about having
            the opportunity to find a great company to work with in a full-time
            capacity.
            <br />
            <br />
            My focus is .NET development including C#, ASP.NET Web API, EFCore,
            SQLite and NUnit, as well as web development, specifically React and
            TypeScript.

              In 2018 I stepped away from my FIFO career offshore to be home
              with my family and care full-time for my father during his battle
              with dementia. Dad relocated to live with me, and I supported him
              in living his best life throughout his illness which led to his
              eventual transition into high-care assisted living facility.
              Seeking a family-friendly career that allowed me to still support
              my father, I transitioned into IT part-time at the end of 2021 and
              continued to support him until his passing in late 2022.
